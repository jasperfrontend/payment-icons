Payment Provider Icons

## Description
This provides an easy way to include payment provider icons in your website or app. It's always a hassle to get a list of supported payment providers so we usually resort to Google Images to steal somebody else's work - And I know you did that, just like I did.

Since stealing isn't good I decided to stop stealing icons from Google Images and instead steal somebody's creative work from Behance which in turn consists of artwork stolen from companies providing payment services with expensive lawyers and all that. So please, read the disclaimer below. It's all for a good cause: Getting more people to use your payment services.

## Usage
I think the usage will be something like
1. **Easy mode:** Install through Composer: `composer require tweemeterstudio/payment-icons`
```
{
    "require": {
        "monolog/monolog": "1.0.*"
    }
}
```
2. **Also quite easy mode:** Download the zip of this repo, extract its folder to your project and include the following line in the `<head>` of your document:
```
<link href="/path/to/payment-icons/payment-icons.min.css">
```
You need to of course mind the path/to/ part when including the payment-icons.min.css file. The css file and `/assets` folder should reside in the same directory!
